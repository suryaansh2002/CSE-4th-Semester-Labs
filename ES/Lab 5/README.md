## Lab 5

1. Write an assembly program to sort an array using selection sort

2. Write an assembly program to find the factorial of an unsigned number using recursion

3. Write an assembly program to search an element in an array of ten 32 bit numbers using linear search.

4. Assume that ten 32 bit numbers are stored in registers R1-R10. Sort these numbers in the empty ascending stack using selection sort and store the sorted array back into the registers. Use STM and LDMDB instructions wherever necessary.
